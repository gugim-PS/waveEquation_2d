2D wave equation using a finite difference method (FDM)

# 2D Wave Equation Simulation (FDM)

This Python code simulates the 2D wave equation using a finite difference method (FDM) with a 3D visualization of the wave propagation. The simulation displays the wave equation solution on a surface plot that evolves over time, showing how the wave moves and changes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`
  - `IPython` (for Jupyter users)
  - `warnings`

You can install the required dependencies by using the following pip command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
